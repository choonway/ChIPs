## tl;dr
Have you wanted to use a construction set to build a model, but don't want to deal with complicated techniques to remove studs / build sideways? Not Square? Too many different types of bricks? Something you can freely 3D print cheaply? etc. Look no further, this is the construction set for you!

## Introduction
ChIPs (Choonway's Interlocking Panels) is an open source (CC-BY 4.0) construction set system that uses interlocking finger joints between panels orientated at 0 degrees or 90 degrees with respect to each other. The resulting object has smooth surfaces on all faces, sharp edges and results in a close physical manifestation of polycube puzzles / voxel art.

In the basic form there are only 4 unique pieces (5th one is for sharp corners)
