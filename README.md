## tl;dr
Have you wanted to use a construction set to build a model, but don't want to deal with complicated techniques to remove studs / build sideways? Not Square? Too many different types of bricks? Something you can freely 3D print cheaply? etc. Look no further, this is the construction set for you!

## Introduction
ChIPs (Choonway's Interlocking Panels) is an open source (CC-BY 4.0) construction set system that uses interlocking finger joints between panels orientated at 0 degrees or 90 degrees with respect to each other. The resulting object has smooth surfaces on all faces, sharp edges and results in a close physical manifestation of polycube puzzles / voxel art.

On the left is the 37.5mm cube variant with panels colored by type. On the right is the featured cat model using 25mm cube variant with sharp corners. The dimension of the cube variant refers to the length of the side of the smallest cube.

Only 4 unique panels (Blue, White, Yellow and Orange) are required for building any model. The 5th panel is optional for sharp corners. Note the sharpness of the ears between the 2 models.

## Guided Build Tutorial

At first glance it might seem confusing which panels to join together to make the object, but not to worry, there is an easy way to figure it with the use of Ephtracy's MagicaVoxel.

Once you are familiar with the system it is not necessary to rely on the software, you can build it intuitively.
